// 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings

// You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and
// an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

// Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

// Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain c
// characters 'a' and 'b'.

function countConsistentStrings(allowed: string, words: string[]): number {}
